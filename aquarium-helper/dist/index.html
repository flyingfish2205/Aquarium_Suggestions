    <h2>Note: This site is still a work in progress</h2>
    The biotope and tank size selector are not functional at this moment. Please take these suggestions with a grain of salt!
    There's also only like 9 fish I've added so far lol. I'm working on adding more, and making this more like a wiki site with info on each fish. Oh yeah and fixing the selectors too. Or maybe I wont. Maybe this website is an art piece, a monument to all the websites and passion projects left abandoned on the hard drives of the middle school computer lab. Who's to say?
